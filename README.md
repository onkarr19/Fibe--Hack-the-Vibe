Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to determine the ability of a person or a small, owner-operated business to repay. Lenders use credit scoring to help decide whether to extend or deny credit as for any organization, even the slightest chance of financial risk can not be ignored or ruled out. 

The objective of this challenge is to create a robust machine-learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans, based on their historical loan repayment behavior and transactional activities.
